        <h1>ClipSync Chrome Extension Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 13, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>ClipSync Chrome Extension</strong> ("ClipSync", "the Extension", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a transparent approach to data handling.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>ClipSync is a Chrome Extension designed to enhance your productivity by providing a persistent and searchable history of your copied content. It helps you manage your clipboard entries, ensuring you can easily retrieve and reuse information.</p>

        <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>ClipSync collects the following types of user data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clipboard Content:</strong> This includes text, URLs, and HTML content that you explicitly copy from webpages (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C, using the right-click "Copy" option, or similar actions).</li>
            <li><strong>Current Tab URLs:</strong> When you open the ClipSync extension's popup, the URL of the active browser tab you are currently viewing is automatically captured.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Collect Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clipboard Content:</strong> Data is collected when you perform a "copy" action on a webpage where the ClipSync content script is active. The content script listens for the browser's native <code>copy</code> event and accesses the <code>clipboardData</code> associated with that event.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Tab URLs:</strong> Data is collected when you click on the ClipSync extension icon in your browser toolbar, which triggers the popup. The popup script then uses Chrome's <code>tabs</code> API to retrieve the URL of the currently active tab.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>The data collected by ClipSync is used <strong>solely</strong> for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To create and maintain your clipboard history:</strong> The collected clipboard content and current tab URLs are stored to build a chronological list of your copied items.</li>
            <li><strong>To enable search functionality:</strong> Your clipboard history is used to allow you to search for specific entries within the extension's popup.</li>
            <li><strong>To facilitate pasting:</strong> Stored items can be copied back to your system clipboard with a single click from the extension's popup, allowing you to paste them elsewhere.</li>
            <li><strong>To manage history:</strong> The extension automatically limits the history to the last 50 items, ensuring efficient storage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data collected by ClipSync (clipboard history and URLs) is stored <strong>exclusively on your local device</strong> within your Chrome browser's local storage (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> Your data is <strong>not transmitted to any external servers, cloud services, or third-party databases.</strong> It remains entirely on your computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> As data is stored locally, its security relies on the security of your device and Chrome browser. ClipSync does not implement additional encryption beyond what Chrome's storage mechanisms provide.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>ClipSync does not share, sell, rent, or trade your collected data with any third parties whatsoever.</strong> Your data remains private to you and is used only within your local instance of the extension.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear History:</strong> You can clear your entire clipboard history at any time by clicking the "Clear All" button within the ClipSync extension popup.</li>
            <li><strong>Uninstalling the Extension:</strong> If you uninstall the ClipSync extension from your Chrome browser, all locally stored clipboard history data associated with the extension will be permanently deleted from your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Browser Controls:</strong> You can manage or disable the ClipSync extension through Chrome's extension management settings (<code>chrome://extensions</code>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the extension after any changes signifies your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
